# tesseract4java: Tesseract GUI


A graphical user interface for the [Tesseract OCR engine][tesseract]. The program has been introduced in the [Master’s
thesis “Analyses and Heuristics for the Improvement of Optical Character Recognition Results for Fraktur Texts”][thesis]
by Paul Vorbach (German).

## Building and running the software

### This fork expects at least java 11

This software is written in Java and can be built using [Apache Maven]. In order to build the software you have to
follow these steps:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/tesseract4java/tesseract4java.git`
 2. `cd tesseract4java`
 3. `git submodule init`
 4. `git submodule update`
 5. `mvn clean package -Pstandalone`. This will include the Tesseract binaries for your platform. You can manually
    define the platform by providing the option `-Djavacpp.platform=[PLATFORM]` (available platforms are
    `windows-x86_64`, `windows-x86`, `linux-x86_64`, `linux-x86`, and `macosx-x86_64`).

After you've run through all steps, the directory "gui/target" will contain the file
"tesseract4java-[VERSION]-[PLATFORM].jar", which you can run by double-clicking or executing
`java -jar tesseract4java-[VERSION]-[PLATFORM].jar`.
